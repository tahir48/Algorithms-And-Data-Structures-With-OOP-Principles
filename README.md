#### Introduction

This repository includes implementation of some algorithms and data structures in several programming languages using principles of Object Oriented Programming.

#### Data Structures and Methods
1. Linked List with constructor, print, append, pop, prepend, pop_first, get, remove, get value and set value methods.
2. Doubly Linked list with constructor, print, append, pop, prepend, pop_first, get, remove, get value and set value methods.
3. Queue with constructor, print, enqueue and dequeue methods.
4. Stacks with constructor, print, push, pop methods.
5. Trees with constructor, insert and contains methods.
6. Hash Tables with constructor, hash, print, set and get methods.
7. Graphs with constructor, print, add vertex, add edge, remove vertex and remove edge methhods.
